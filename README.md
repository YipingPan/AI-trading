# AI stock trading

Hello,

This is the repository for AI stock trading system project in the course Big Data Analytics 6895.
The data is acquired from Tushare's API, which contain over 3700 stocks information from CN stock markets.
Starting from basic RL concepts and RNN used for time series prediction, we are going to use actor-critic policy gradient which is one of DRL concepts, as well as mainly LSTM from RNN for stocks price prediction.

We have three milestones.

For milestone 1, we have finished task analysis and data acquisition.
For milestone 2, algorithm schema design and prototype code testing are in progress.
For milestone 3, we are going to complete the deployment of the backend  of the trading system.
For more work, if time permitted, a frontend design is also within consideration and then a website visualization will be realized.
